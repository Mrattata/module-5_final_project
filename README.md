This is my website replica porject, It is based on the EDHREC.com website.
many of the links refer to pages on the main EDHREC site.
I used Bootstrap with a little CSS to style the site.
I used cards, a carousel, and an accordion as my main bootstrap components.
I did four functions for part 2 
The first has the button on the home page shout a phrase at you.
The second sends alerts based on price changes
The third is a function for adding cards to a deck
The fourth is for identifying your commander for the deck.
